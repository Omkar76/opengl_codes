Drawing a 1000 dots in circular area. count it yourself if you think they are not 1000 :eyes:

I have used C's `rand()` function from `stdlib.h`. random distribution seems to be more concentrated near center. Maybe using 
[uniform_int_distribution](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/uniform_int_distribution) from c++11 can fix that but for simplicity I'll keep it in C. at least for now.
